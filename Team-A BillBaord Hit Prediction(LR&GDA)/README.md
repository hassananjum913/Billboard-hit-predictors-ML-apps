# <h1>BillBoard Hit Prediction using machine Learning</h1><br>

## Introduction

BillBoard data source contains the track records which were in the Hit List at some point in time in their chart. Million songs data source contains information of Million Songs and its different attributes. Lastly, we have a Spotify data source containing all the tracks and their key features describing their specifications and properties. In this project, we utilized these data sources and tried to predict whether a given track will be a Hit or Not based on certain features using Machine Learning Algorithm.

## Technical Design and Approach

&#9658; ML Algorithms used : <br>
&#8226; Logistic Regression (https://bhp-flask-heroku.herokuapp.com/) <br>
&#8226;  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (https://bhp-streamlit-heroku.herokuapp.com/ )<br>

&#9658; Accuracy Max Score :<br>
&#8226; 79% (with hyper parameters and cross validation) <br>


&#9658; Deployment Strategy :<br>
&#8226; Web and Local : Flask and Streamlit <br>
&#8226; Cloud PaaS : Heroku <br>
